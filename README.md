# Dijkstra-project
A Dijkstra simulation app using Python and Tkinter made in 2022
Specifics: Researched Dijkstra algorithm with heap and efficient map spawning, drawing, and deleting algorithms,
leading to a total runtime of 0.7 seconds initialization time and 0.01 seconds query time with 200 points in maps.
Bad coding during this period :(

# How to use:
Download the project, open dijkstraproject.py, open it, and enjoy!

Click on the maze: left mouse for starting point, right mouse for end point 
Some features that you can use:
- Generate random map (Tạo map random): Given length (Chiều dài), height (Chiều cao), create a maze
- Input a map (Nhập đồ thị): Input a map based on your preference
- Delete a map (Xoá map): Delete the map that is currently used
- Show path (Đường đi): Show the path from start to finish
- Generate graph (Tạo đồ thị): Generate graph that is created from the map
- Switch color (Đổi màu): Change color theme of the app
