# Dijkstra-project
A Dijkstra simulation app using Python and Tkinter made in 2022
Specifics: Researched Dijkstra algorithm with heap and efficient map spawning, drawing, and deleting algorithms,
leading to a total runtime of 0.7 seconds initialization time and 0.01 seconds query time with 200 points in maps.
Bad coding during this period :(
